= EAP 7.4 application deployment on OpenShift
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

In this module we're going to go through the process of deploying a JBoss EAP 7.4 application on OpenShift.  We're going to do this using the OpenShift console.  

Red Hat have developed a lot of tools to provision Red Hat Application services and dependencies on OpenShift.  These tools include:

* JBoss EAP Helm chart to configure and build JBoss EAP applications for OpenShift
* JBoss EAP Operator to deploy JBoss EAP applications on OpenShift
* AMQ Broker Operator to deploy and configure AMQ Broker instances and topics on OpenShift
* Red Hat SSO Operator to deploy and configure Red Hat SSO instances on OpenShift

In this lab, we're going to use these tools to simplify the deployment of our application on OpenShift.

== Red Hat SSO configuration

We've already deployed an instance of Red Hat SSO using the Red Hat SSO operator, this is configured and ready to use. Before we deploy the application to OpenShift we need to verify the Red Hat SSO configuration and push our changes to our individual gitea account.

*Step 3.1:* In the IDE, open the file: coolstore/src/main/webapp/keycloak.json and ensure the contents are as follows:

[source,json,role="copypaste"]
----
{
    "realm": "eap",
    "auth-server-url": "https://keycloak-sso.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/auth",
    "ssl-required": "external",
    "resource": "eap-app",
    "public-client": true,
    "confidential-port": 0
}
----

*Step 3.2:* Click on the "Source Control" icon in the IDE, you should see the following:

image::git-1.png[source-contol]

Enter a commit message in the message field and click on the "Commit" button.

*Step 3.2:* You will be prompted to stage files to the commit

image::git-2.png[stage-files]

Click on "Yes" and then click on "Sync Changes" to push your changes to gitea

*Step 3.3:* You will be prompted to enter a username:

image::git-3.png[git-username]

Enter `{{ USER_ID }}`

*Step 3.4:* You will then be prompted for a password:

Enter `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

Your changes will be pushed to gitea.

## Deploying on OpenShift

*Step 3.5:* Access the OpenShift console by clicking on the following {{ CONSOLE_URL }}[link^] 

Login with the following credentials:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

*Step 3.6: Switch to the project called "{{ USER_ID }}-project"*

## Deploy a PostgreSQL database

*Step 3.7:* Within this project, add a PostgreSQL database by Clicking on "+Add" and selecting "Database" from the Developer catalog.

*Step 3.8:* From the Developer catalog, select the "PostgreSQL" template and fill out the form details as shown below.

image::postgresql-template.png[postgresql-template,80%]
[source,sh]
----
* User name: postgresUser
* Password: postgresPW
* Database name: postgresDB
----

*Step 3.9:* Click on "Create" to create the postgreSQL database instance.

## Deploy an AMQ broker instance

Our application will require an external message queue.  We'll use the AMQ Broker operator to deploy and configure an AMQ broker instance

*Step 3.10:* Click on "+Add" and select "Operator Backed"

From the list below, select "ActiveMQ Artemis"

image::operator-backed.png[operator-backed,80%]

*Step 3.11:* From the next screen, click on "Create" and then paste the following YAML into the "YAML view" editor

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: eap74-amq7
spec:
  acceptors:
    - name: my-acceptor
      port: 61616
      protocols: 'core'
  deploymentPlan:
    image: placeholder
    jolokiaAgentEnabled: false
    journalType: nio
    managementRBACEnabled: true
    messageMigration: false
    persistenceEnabled: false
    requireLogin: false
    size: 2
  console:
    expose: true
----

Next, we're going to create an "AMQ Artemis Address"

*Step 3.12:* Click on "+Add" again, select "Operator Backed" and then choose "AMQ Artemis Address"

*Step 3.13:* From the next screen, click on "Create" and then paste the following YAML into the "YAML view" editor

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: artemis-address-topic
spec:
  addressName: topic.orders
  queueName: topic/orders
  routingType: multicast
----

## Deploying the application to OpenShift

When we deploy our EAP application on OpenShift we need to add the PostgreSQL datasource and driver. In this example we're going to make use the of the https://github.com/jbossas/eap-datasources-galleon-pack[Eap datasources galleon feature pack^]. This feature pack provides a "postgresql-datasource" layer which will install and configure the postgreSQL datasource for us.

We're going to use Helm to build our OpenShift EAP Image.  Within the Helm config you'll notice build environment variables defining the following

* GALLEON_PROVISION_FEATURE_PACKS: org.jboss.eap:eap-datasources-galleon-pack:7.4.0.GA-redhat-00003

This adds the eap-datasources galleaon pack for EAP 7.4

* GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS: cloud-server,web-clustering,postgresql-datasource,ejb

This adds the required layers to support our application including the postgresql-datasource, web-clustering, and ejb layers

* POSTGRESQL_DRIVER_VERSION: 42.6.0

This defines the version of the PostgreSQL driver to deploy

Click on "+Add" again and this time select "Helm Chart" from the Developer Catalog

Filter by "eap" to locate the "JBoss EAP 7.4" Helm chart.

image::helm-charts.png[helm-charts,80%]

Click on "JBoss EAP 7.4", and click on "Create"

*Step 3.14:* From the "Create Helm Release" page, select the "YAML view"

Paste the following YAML to create the EAP 7.4 builds.

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]

deploy:
  enabled: false
----

*Step 3.15:* Click on "Create" and then select "Builds" from the left menu.  You should see two builds created as shown below:

image::build-configs.png[build-configs,80%]

=== eap74-build-artifacts build

This build uses the eap74-openjdk11-openshift-rhel8 image to perform the following steps:

* Deploy an instance of JBoss EAP
* Run build-time scripts to configure the sub-systems to support the target application
* Perform a maven build of application using the source code 
* Deploy the target application

=== eap74 build

This build uses the eap74-openjdk11-runtime-openshift-rhel8 image to perform the following steps:

* Copy the deployed JBoss EAP instance and deployed image from the previous build
* Run any runtime configuration scripts, e.g. configure database connections
* Run the JBoss EAP instance

It will take a few minutes for these builds to complete.  While this is happening we can go ahead and create a config map containing runtime variables and then deploy using the EAP Operator.  

This config map contains non-sensitive information relating to the PostgreSQL connection and AMQ broker connection such as the database service host and database name, the AMQ broker service host and topic names.  Sensitive information such as username / password will be pulled from the secrets created when these services where deployed.

*Step 3.16:* To create the config map, click on "ConfigMaps" on the left menu and click on "Create ConfigMap".  From the "Create ConfigMap" page, select "YAML view" and paste the following text:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: eap-config
data: 
  # Configuration to connnect to PostgreSQL
  POSTGRESQL_DATABASE: postgresDB
  POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE: CoolstoreDS
  POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST: postgresql
  # Configuration to connect to AMQ Broker
  MQ_SERVICE_PREFIX_MAPPING: eap74-amq7=MQ
  EAP74_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_HOST: eap74-amq7-hdls-svc
  EAP74_AMQ_TCP_SERVICE_PORT: "61616"
  MQ_TOPICS: orders
  AMQ_JNDI: java:/eap74-amq7/ConnectionFactory
----

Because our application requires clustering support, we also need to create a service account with permissions to view the pods in the cluster.

*Step 3.17:* Click on the "Import YAML" button on the top right and paste the following:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: coolstoresa
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-viewer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-viewer

roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: pod-viewer
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: coolstoresa
----

*Step 3.18:* Finally, we can use the EAP Operator to deploy our EAP image.  Click on "+Add" again and then select "Operator Backed" from the Developer Catalog.  

image::operator-backed.png[operator-backed,80%]

*Step 3.19:* From the list of operator backed options, click on "WildFlyServer", and click on "Create".  From the "Create WildFlyServer" page, select "YAML view" and paste the following:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: wildfly.org/v1alpha1
kind: WildFlyServer
metadata:
  name: eap74
spec:
  serviceAccountName: coolstoresa
  applicationImage: eap74:latest
  replicas: 1
  envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: eap-config
  env:
    # Credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL databases
    # and AMQ Broker are taken from their secrets
    - name: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-password
          name: postgresql
    - name: POSTGRESQL_USER
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: database-user
          name: postgresql
    - name: MQ_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: AMQ_USER
          name: eap74-amq7-credentials-secret
    - name: MQ_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: AMQ_PASSWORD
          name: eap74-amq7-credentials-secret
----

As we mentioned above,the sensitive credentials (username and password) are pulled from the postgresql and eap74-amq7-credentials-secret secrets in the WildFlyServer custom resource, while the non-sensitive credentials are pulled form the config map we created.

Click on "Create" to create the WildFlyServer custom resource.

Finally we need to create a route to our application

*Step 3.20:* Click on the "Import YAML" button on the top right and paste the following:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
kind: Route
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: coolstore
  namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-project
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: eap-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/name: eap74
    app.openshift.io/runtime: eap
    wildfly.org/operated-by-headless: active
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: eap74-headless
  tls:
    termination: edge
    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: ''
    destinationCACertificate: ''
  port:
    targetPort: http
----

*Step 3.21:* Click on the "Topology" link on the left menu to view the deployed applications:

image::topology-view.png[topology-view,80%]

*Note: The "eap74" application may take a few minutes to start-up, while the builds are completed. The application will be ready when the outer ring is dark blue*

*Step 3.22:* You should be able to view the application landing page by clicking on the external link icon.

image::coolstore.png[kitchen-sink,80%]

Our application is now successfully deployed on OpenShift.  Next, we're going to deploy an instance of JBoss EAP 8 and migrate our application.
