= Migrate application from JBoss EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

{{ EAP8_VERSION }} introduces breaking changes to application written for JBoss EAP 7.4.  

To perform code analysis of our JBoss EAP 7.4 application, we will use the latest version of the Migration Toolkit for Runtimes.

cd /shared

unzip  {{ MTR_ARCHIVE }}

From the MTR landing page, click on Create Project.

Enter a project name (e.g., eap7-eap8) and click on Next.

Then, we need to locate the application source code

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app
----

image::mtr-2.png[migration,800]

Set the target to "eap8"
image::mtr-3.png[migration,800]

Select the packages
image::mtr-4.png[migration,800]

Skip through the remaining screens

image::mtr-5.png[migration,800]

Click on "Save and Run"

Once the report has been generated you will see the analysis results as shown below

image::mtr-6.png[migration,800]

Click on the report icon (highlighted in the image) to view the report.

The report results will be shown as below 

image::mtr-7.png[migration,800]

You'll see from this report an estimation of 84 story points to migrate from JBoss EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}.

You can click through the various tabs of the report to view the details.  For example, clicking on the "Issues" tab will show the details of the changes required.

== Using the Migration Toolkit for Runtimes VS Code extension

First we need to unzip the Migratio Toolkit for Runtimes CLI tool

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd /shared
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
unzip {{ MTR_CLI_ARCHIVE }} 
----

Add the VS-Code Migration Toolkit for Runtimes extension 

image::mtr-vscode.png[migration,800]

Configure the MTR VS-Code extension as follows

image::mtr-vscode-2.png[migration,800]

To perform the code analysis, click on the start button as shown below

image::mtr-vscode-3.png[migration,400]

Once the analysis is complete, you should see a file hierachy in the left hand window.  CLicking on a file will open up the editor showing where the issues are with the file.

You can make the edits directly in the file as indicated, or in some cases you can right click on the file and select "Apply all quickfixes"

== Automating code changes

A large portion of the mandatory changes are related to the namespace change from javax to jakarta.

The migration toolkit for runtimes provides https://docs.openrewrite.org/[OpenRewrite, window="_blank"] rules to automate these changes.  

To run OpenRewrite against our application code, run the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/shared/{{ MTR_CLI_DIR }}/bin/windup-cli --openrewrite "-DactiveRecipes=org.jboss.windup.JavaxToJakarta" "-Drewrite.configLocation=/shared/mtr-cli-1.1.0.GA-redhat-00003/rules/openrewrite/jakarta/javax/imports/rewrite.yml" --input /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app --goal run
----

== Remaining file changes

Other than the namespace changes, the migration toolkit for runtimes report identified changes in the following files:

* pom.xml
* persistence.xml
* faces-config.xml

We can go through the changes as detailed in the report, or copy these files from a pre-prepared {{ EAP8_VERSION }} version of the app in the /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app-eap8 folder by running the following commands.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cp /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app-eap8/pom.xml /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cp /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app-eap8/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app/src/main/resources/META-INF/
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cp /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app-eap8/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/faces-config.xml /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF
----

We can now deploy our {{ EAP8_VERSION }} application

Shut down the Migration Toolkit for Runtimes

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
export EAP_HOME=/shared/{{ JBOSS8_DIR }}  
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
----

In a second terminal enter the following from the /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app folder

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
----

You will now be able to access the kitchensink application by copying the url from the public endpoint and pasting it into your browser:

image::public-endpoint.png[public-endpoint,200]

The kitchensink application should load as follows

image::kitchen-sink.png[public-endpoint,800]

We've now successfully deployed our sample application to {{ EAP8_VERSION }} connecting to an external PostgreSQL database.
