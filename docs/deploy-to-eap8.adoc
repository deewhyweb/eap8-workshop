From the MTR landing page, click on Create Project.

Enter a project name (e.g., eap7-eap8) and click on Next.

Then, we need to locate the application source code

You'll see from this report an estimation of 84 story points to migrate from JBoss EAP 7.4 to JBoss EAP 8-Beta.

You can click through the various tabs of the report to view the details.  For example, clicking on the "Issues" tab will show the details of the changes required.

== Automating code changes

A large portion of the mandatory changes are related to the namespace change from javax to jakarta.

The migration toolkit for runtimes provides https://docs.openrewrite.org/[OpenRewrite, window="_blank"] rules to automate these changes.  

To run OpenRewrite against our application code, run the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/shared/mtr-web-distribution-1.1.0.GA-redhat-00003/bin/windup-cli --openrewrite "-DactiveRecipes=org.jboss.windup.JavaxToJakarta" "-Drewrite.configLocation=/shared/mtr-cli-1.1.0.GA-redhat-00003/rules/openrewrite/jakarta/javax/imports/rewrite.yml" --input /projects/jboss7-quickstarts/sample-app --goal run
