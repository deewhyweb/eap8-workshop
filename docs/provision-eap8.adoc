= Traditional app deployment on JBoss 7.4
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

The release of {{ EAP8_VERSION }} provides support for https://jakarta.ee/release/10/[Jakarta EE 10, window="_blank"]. Jakarta EE 10 brings a change to Jakarta EE APIs compared to the Jakarta EE 8 specifications supported by EAP 7.4. 

Moving applications from JBoss EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }} will require code changes due to the move from Jakarta EE 8 to Jakarta EE 10 (e.g., converting from the “javax” namespace to “jakarta” namespace). These changes are documented in this https://access.redhat.com/articles/6980265[article, window="_blank"]. To help our customers with this migration effort we've updated our tools: the https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/download[Migration Toolkit for Applications, window="_blank"], including the Migration Toolkit for Runtimes (MTR, for non-OpenShift projects) and the JBoss EAP Server Migration tool. 

In this section we're going to use the JBoss EAP Server Migration tool migrate the server configuration from JBoss EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}

## Server configuration changes

When we deployed our application to JBoss EAP 7.4, we made some changes to the server configuration to add a module and driver to connect to PostgreSQL and to configure the message queue. We must ensure these modules and drivers are in place and working correctly in our {{ EAP8_VERSION }} server. We can use the JBoss EAP server migration tool to perform this migration for us.  

*Step 1:* We have provided a distribution archive for the server migration tool in the /shared folder.  To extract this, follow these steps:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd /shared & unzip {{ SERVER_MIGRATION_ARCHIVE }} & cd {{ SERVER_MIGRATION_DIR }}
----

The workshop has two instances of JBoss EAP deployed.

JBoss EAP 7.4 with a home directory of /shared/jboss-eap-7.4 stored in the EAP7_HOME environment variable

{{ EAP8_VERSION }} with a home directory of /shared/{{ JBOSS8_DIR }} stored in the EAP8_HOME environment variable.

Our JBoss 7.4 instance is using the "standalone_full.xml" configuration, so this is the only one we need to migrate from JBoss EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}.

*Step 2:* To run the server migration tool to migrate from our JBoss 7.4 instance to our {{ EAP8_VERSION }} instance, run the following command:

IMPORTANT: This tool will fail and report an error, this is expected behavior and part of the workshop.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
./jboss-server-migration.sh -s $EAP7_HOME -t $EAP8_HOME
----

The server migration tool will ask a series of questions during the migration process:

image::mig1.png[migration,1150]
*Step 3:* Choose *yes.* to migrate the standalone configuration.

image::mig2.png[migration,1150]
*Step 4:* Choose no. We want to select the configurations to migrate.

image::mig3.png[migration,1150]
*Step 5:* Choose no. We don't want to migrate standalone-full-ha.xml.

image::mig4.png[migration,1150]
*Step 6:* Choose *yes.* We want to migrate standalone-full.xml

The server migration tool will now report an error:

`
 ERROR Migration failed: org.jboss.migration.core.ServerMigrationFailureException: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: The source configuration includes Vault, which migration is unsupported by the tool and needs to be done manually in advance. If you want to proceed with the migration please restart migration with environment property security.migrate-vault.fail-if-vault-found set as false.
`

So we need to migrate our vault base password store to Elytron credential store before we can run the server migration.
So let's do this on our JBoss 7 cluster first before we continue.

*Step 7:* Run the following command to migrate the legacy vault to a credential store called "my_vault_converted.cred_store" located in "$EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/".

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP7_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh vault --keystore $EAP7_HOME/vault/vault.keystore --keystore-password vault22 --enc-dir $EAP7_HOME/vault/ --salt 1234abcd --iteration 120 --alias vault --location $EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/my_vault_converted.cred_store
----

*Step 8:* We should now be able to list the entries in the new credential store

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP7_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location=$EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/my_vault_converted.cred_store --aliases
----

You will be prompted to enter the credential store password: enter "vault22"

You will now see the list of entries in the credential store.

[source,sh]
----
Credential store contains following aliases: vb::dbpass vb::dbusername
----

*Step 9:* For fields like username it is not possible to reference the credential store as credential stores specifically handle the storage of credentials not general purpose strings.  For this reason we're going to reference the username as an encrypted expression.  To do this we will first need to add a SecretKey to the credential store.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP7_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location=$EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/my_vault_converted.cred_store --generate-secret-key secret
----

You will be prompted to enter the credential store password: enter "vault22"

You should get the following response from the command:

[source,sh]
----
Alias "secret" has been successfully stored
----

*Step 10:* We now need to add the credential store and expression resolver to the server. Login to the via the JBoss CLI

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=127.0.0.1:10090
----

*Step 11:* Create a credential store called exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore using the credential store "my_vault_converted.cred_store" located in "$EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/"(jboss.server.config.dir)

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore:add(relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,modifiable=true,location=my_vault_converted.cred_store,implementation-properties={"keyStoreType"=>"JCEKS"},credential-reference={clear-text="MASK-5dOaAVafCSd;1234abcd;120"})
----

*Step 12:* Define an expression resolver using the secret we created previously.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=elytron/expression=encryption:add(default-resolver=converted, resolvers=[{name=converted, credential-store=exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore, secret-key=secret}])
----

*Step 13:* Test the credential store aliases

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore:read-aliases()
----

You should see three results listed as follows:

[source,sh]
----
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        "vb::dbpass",
        "secret",
        "vb::dbusername"
    ]
}
----

*Step 14:* Now that we have a working credential store, we can use this for our database credentials. First,
remove the password attribute from the postgresql data-source.  Still in the JBoss CLI enter:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=postgresql:undefine-attribute(name=password)
----

*Step 15:* Create a credential-reference attribute for the postgresql data-source to provide the password form the exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore credential store.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=postgresql:write-attribute(name=credential-reference,value={store=exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore,alias=vb::dbpass})
----

*Step 16:* Then reload the server configuration and exit

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
reload
exit
----

*Step 17:* Run the following to create an ecrypted token from the value of vb::dbusername in the credential store.  

NOTE: We're using the elytron-tool.sh located in $EAP8_HOME, the --entry flag feature was implemented in JBoss EAP 8-Beta.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP8_HOME/bin/elytron-tool.sh credential-store --location=$EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/my_vault_converted.cred_store --encrypt secret --entry vb::dbusername
----

You will be prompted to enter the credential store password: enter "vault22"

You should now see the encrypted token e.g.

[source,sh]
----
Clear text encrypted to token 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=' using alias 'secret'.
----

IMPORTANT: We will need use this token as our user-name attribute on the postgresql data-source in a later step below.

*Step 18:* Login to the JBoss CLI

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=127.0.0.1:10090
----

*Step 19:* Remove the previous user-name attribute from the postresql data-source

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=postgresql:undefine-attribute(name=user-name)
----

*Step 20:* Run the following command to use a token for user-name, replacing "xxxx" with the token produced in step 17.

NOTE: You you will need to use kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+C] to copy the encrypted token.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=postgresql:write-attribute(name=user-name, value="${ENC::xxxx}")
----

*Step 21:* Remove the legacy vault from JBoss EAP 7.4

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/core-service=vault:remove
----

*Step 22:* Reload the JBoss configuration end exit

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
reload
exit
----

*Step 23:* No we can re-run the server migration tool

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/shared/jboss-server-migration/jboss-server-migration.sh -s $EAP7_HOME -t $EAP8_HOME
----

The server migration tool will ask a series of questions during the migration process:

image::mig1.png[migration,1150]
*Step 24:* Choose *yes.* to migrate the standalone configuration.

image::mig2.png[migration,1150]
*Step 25:* Choose no. We want to select the configurations to migrate.

image::mig3.png[migration,1150]
*Step 26:* Choose no. We don't want to migrate standalone-full-ha.xml.

image::mig4.png[migration,1150]
*Step 27:* Choose *yes.* We want to migrate standalone-full.xml

image::mig5.png[migration,1150]
*Step 28:* Choose no. We don't want to migrate standalone-ha.xml.

image::mig6.png[migration,1150]
*Step 29:* Choose no. We don't want to migrate standalone-load-balancer.xml.

image::mig7.png[migration,1150] 
*Step 30:* Choose no. We don't want to migrate standalone.xml.

image::mig8.png[migration,1150]
*Step 31:* Choose no. We are not using a managed domain.

image::mig9.png[migration,1150]

*Step 32:* The server migration is now complete, we need to copy the credential store from EAP 7.4 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cp /shared/jboss-eap-7.4/standalone/configuration/my_vault_converted.cred_store /shared/jboss-eap-8.0/standalone/configuration/
----

*Step 33:* We can now connect to JBoss EAP 8 by running the following command

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$EAP8_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=127.0.0.1:10190
----

*Step 34:* We will now trigger a reload of the {{ EAP8_VERSION }} server.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
reload
----

You will be prompted to enter the {{ EAP8_VERSION }} admin credentials.  

username: admin
password: password

*Step 35:* Look at the credential store aliases

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=elytron/credential-store=exampleKeyStoreCredentialStore:read-aliases()
----

[source,sh]
----
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        "vb::dbpass",
        "secret",
        "vb::dbusername"
    ]
}
----

*Step 36:* And look at the list of installed drivers.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources:installed-drivers-list
----

The output should show the PostgreSQL driver as follows:
[source]
----
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        {
            "driver-name" => "postgresql",
            "deployment-name" => undefined,
            "driver-module-name" => "org.postgresql",
            "module-slot" => "main",
            "driver-datasource-class-name" => "",
            "driver-xa-datasource-class-name" => "",
            "datasource-class-info" => undefined,
            "driver-class-name" => "org.postgresql.Driver",
            "driver-major-version" => 42,
            "driver-minor-version" => 6,
            "jdbc-compliant" => false
        },
        {
            "driver-name" => "h2",
            "deployment-name" => undefined,
            "driver-module-name" => "com.h2database.h2",
            "module-slot" => "main",
            "driver-datasource-class-name" => "",
            "driver-xa-datasource-class-name" => "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource",
            "datasource-class-info" => [{"org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource" => {
                "URL" => "java.lang.String",
                "description" => "java.lang.String",
                "loginTimeout" => "int",
                "password" => "java.lang.String",
                "url" => "java.lang.String",
                "user" => "java.lang.String"
            }}],
            "driver-class-name" => "org.h2.Driver",
            "driver-major-version" => 2,
            "driver-minor-version" => 1,
            "jdbc-compliant" => true
        }
    ]
}
----

*Step 37:* And test our datasource connection with the following JBoss CLI command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=postgresql:test-connection-in-pool
----

A successful connection should result in the following response:
[source]
----
{

    "outcome" => "success",

    "result" => [true]

}
----

*Step 38:* We're going to add our hostname to the list of allowed-origins to avoid CORS issues.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
/core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface:list-add(name=allowed-origins,value=https://{{ USER_ID }}-jboss-workshop-eap8-console.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }})
----

*Step 39:* Finally, reload the server configuration:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
reload
----

We can also login to the {{ EAP8_VERSION }} admin console https://{{ USER_ID }}-jboss-workshop-eap8-console.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}[here, window="_blank"]

username: admin
password: password

We should be able to see the postgresql datasource connection by navigating to "Configuration" -> "Subsystems" -> "Datasources & Drivers" -> "Datasources" -> "postgresql".  

image::jboss8-console-datasource.png[datasource,800]

We can also view the JMS topic we created by clicking https://{{ USER_ID }}-jboss-workshop-eap8-console.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/console/index.html#messaging-server-destination;server=default[here, window="_blank"]

and then selecting "JMS Topic".
  
image::jboss8-console-jms.png[jms,800]

We can now be confident our application will have the required drivers and data sources present.

{{ EAP8_VERSION }} is now successfully deployed and the server configuration migrated from JBoss EAP 7.4
