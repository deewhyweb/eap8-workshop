= EAP 7 to EAP 8 migration workshop
:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of migrating a JBoss EAP 7.4 server to JBoss EAP 8-Beta.  The workshop covers the following areas:

* Configure a JBoss 7.4 instance to connect to an external database
* Build and deploy a JBoss EAP application to a running instance of JBoss EAP 7.4
* Use the server migration tool to migrate a JBoss EAP 7.4 server configuration to JBoss EAP 8-Beta
* Use the MTR to identify code changes required to migrate an application from JBoss EAP 7.4 to JBoss EAP 8-Beta
* Use openrewrite to automate some of the code changes identified by the MTR
* Build, deploy and test the application on JBoss EAP 8-Beta
* Add the eap-maven-plugin to enable the application to be deployed on OpenShift
* Test the eap-maven-plugin in local environment
* Build application image in OpenShift
* Deploy application image to OpenShift using the EAP operator

== First Step: Set Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

## Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[CodeReady Workspaces^]. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the CodeReady Workspaces instance^] and log in using the username and password you've been assigned:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of
the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number).

You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green {{ USER_ID}}-namespace that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen:

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

Ready? Let's go!
