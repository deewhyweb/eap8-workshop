== First Step: Set Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

=== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment.

NOTE:To paste into the terminal in your development environment use kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+V]

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

=== Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] you will be presented with an option to login with your OpenShift credentials

image::openshift-login.png[openshift-login,80%]

Click on "Login with OpenShift"

and log in using the username and password you've been assigned:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`

You will be promted to Authorize access to the devspaces client to access your acocunt.  Click on "Allow Selected Permissions"

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace.  

When the workspace first loads you will be prompted to with a message "Do you trust the authors of the files in this workspace?" 

image::trust.png[trust, 50%]

Click on "Yes, I trust these authors"

// IMPORTANT: You will need to clone your personal git repository before you proceed with the workshop.

// image::git-start.png[git-start, 80%]

// Click on "Clone Git Repository..."

// NOTE: If you don't see a "Clone Git Repository..." link, click on kbd:[CTRL+SHIFT+P] to enter the command pallate, and then enter "Git clone".

// You will see the following at the top of your dev workspace:

// image::git-url.png[clone-repo, 80%]

// In the url bar enter the name of your personal git repository:

// [source,sh,role="copypaste"]
// ----
// http://gitea.gitea.svc.cluster.local:3000/{{ USER_ID }}/workshop.git

// ----

// Click on "Clone from url: \http://gitea.gitea.svc.cluster.local:3000/{{ USER_ID }}/workshop.git"

// You will be asked to choose a folder, enter: 

// [source,sh,role="copypaste"]

// Click on "OK"

// You will see the following message box:

// image::git-workspace.png[git-workspace, 80%]

// Click on "Open"

// Your window will refresh and you should see:

image::devspaces-start.png[devspaces-start, 80%]

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

=== Running terminal commands

Throughout this workshop you will be running commands in the integrated terminal. 

Access the terminal in dev spaces by clicking on "Menu" -> "Terminal" -> "New Terminal"

=== Configuring GIT

We will be pushing code changes to a git repository we have provisioned for each user.  Before pushing to git you will need to set your git email and name.  To do this, from the integrated terminal, enter the following commands.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
 git config --global user.email "{{ USER_ID }}@example.com"
 git config --global user.name "{{ USER_ID }}"
