:experimental:
:imagesdir: images

== Workshop goals
This workshop will guide you through the migration of an application from JBoss EAP 7 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }} on traditional environments and OpenShift. The workshop makes use of tools to perform server configuration migration and code analysis.  The workshop covers the following areas:

* Deployment of a sample application on JBoss EAP 7.4 
* Deploy sample JBoss EAP 7.4 application on OpenShift
* Provision {{ EAP8_VERSION }} server
* Perform code changes to migrate from EAP 7 to {{ EAP8_VERSION }}
* Migrate {{ EAP8_VERSION }} application to OpenShift
* Deploy {{ EAP8_VERSION }} application to OpenShift


=== First Step: Set Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

=== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

=== Access Your Development Environment

You will be using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ CHE_URL }}[access the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] you will be presented with an option to login with your OpenShift credentials

Click on "Login with OpenShift"

and log in using the username and password you've been assigned:

* *Username*: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* *Password*: `{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`


Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the "jboss-workshop" workspace on the left, as shown below.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

Ready? Let's go!
